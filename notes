What am I trying to do? 

Get movies from movie API
- User searches, the results autopopulate as he types. 
- Click a movie, it's added to your list. 

Can we use a template for the movie results? 
Maybe the same movie item template? 

Can we use a non db data to populate the list? 
- It is a DB, just not ours. 
- We want to use an object to populate a list. 
- But really, it's just a function that manually adds another LI, it's not Angular. 
- 


Movie Adding should be it's own view seperate from Movie Browsing. 

Collections can be made manually? 


var collection = new TestCollection();
 
collection.add([
  {"name": "Duke"},
  {"name": "Scarlett"}
]);
